1. guide users between two screens by expressing that part of the hierarchy
2. lift and expand the child element during hierarchical forward transition
3. screens on the same level of hierarchy are called peers; peers with the same parent are called siblings
4. slide in/out during lateral transition between siblings
5. fade through during lateral transition between root level screens
