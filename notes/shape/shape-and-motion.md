# [Shape and Motion](https://material.io/design/shape/shape-motion.html)
1. > Morphing is the act of changing one shape into another. Shapes can morph in response to changes in state or content, or as a result of user interaction.
2. morphing shapes:
    + dimensions - change or maintain
    + stretch/shrink - preserve proportions
    + resize - maintain aspect ratios
    + transform into another
3. do **not** separate surface from content when morphing
4. surfaces are rectangles by default because they maximize space for content
5. rectangle also blends well, thus reduces user attention
