# [Shape as Expression](https://material.io/design/shape/shape-as-expression.html)
1. shape should be used consistently across the same state and interactions
2. change shapes after a user-initiated action or state change
3. shapes shouldn't be too small to be noticeable; it shouldn't be too large if it's not interactive
