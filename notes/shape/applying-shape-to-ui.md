# [Applying Shape to UI](https://material.io/design/shape/applying-shape-to-ui.html)
1. [shape categories](https://material.io/design/shape/applying-shape-to-ui.html#shape-scheme)
2. three shape categories: small, medium and large
3. three shape attributes:
   + shape family - rounded corner or cut corner
   + shape size - absolute corner size or percentage corner size
   + shape symmetry - symmetric corners or asymmetric corners
4. use absolute corner sizes for components with dynamic height
5. apply attributes to a whole category, then override individually
6. [baseline values](https://material.io/design/shape/applying-shape-to-ui.html#baseline-shape-values)
7. some components' shapes are not customizable
