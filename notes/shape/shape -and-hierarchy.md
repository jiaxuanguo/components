# [Shape and Hierarchy](https://material.io/design/shape/shape-hierarchy.html)
1. components with unique shapes stand out; emphasize a component by giving it a unique shape
2. connect surfaces through shapes:
    + similar shapes indicate a peer relationship
    + use arrow-like shapes to point to a related surface
    + show separation of two surfaces
