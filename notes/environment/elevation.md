# [Elevation](https://material.io/design/environment/elevation.html)
1. the distance between surfaces, measured in multiplier of surface thickness, depicted with shadows (and less frequently fills and opacity)
2. every surface has an elevation value(z-index)
3. elevation value of a component can change in response to user or system events; the default value of a type of component is called its resting elevation
4. resting elevation of the same component may vary based on the environment
5. dynamic elevation offsets are default elevations a component moves to when not resting
6. a component shouldn't collide with other components when changing its elevation
7. depict elevation by:
    - contrast surfaces
    - overlap surfaces
    - adjust shadow width and diffusion
    - animate elevation changes
8. organize elevation hierarchy according to the importance of contents
9. [default elevations](https://material.io/design/environment/elevation.html#default-elevations)
