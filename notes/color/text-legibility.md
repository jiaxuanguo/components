# [Text Legibility](https://material.io/design/color/text-legibility.html)
1. black text on light backgrounds, white text on dark backgrounds
2. black/white text with reduced opacity creates better contrast than gray text
3. three opacity levels for dark text - 87%, 60% and 38%
4. use colored text sparingly to draw attention
5. text types:
   + helper text: 87% black, 60% black, 100% error
   + selected text: add a background color, change selected text's color if necessary; alternatively use text treatments such as outlines or checkmark icons 
   + icons and symbols: same as dark text
