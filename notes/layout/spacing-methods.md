# [Spacing Methods](https://material.io/design/layout/spacing-methods.html)
1. components align to 8dp square baseline grid; elements within components align to 4dp grid
2. types can be off-grid when they are centered inside components
3. spacing methods of elements within components include padding, dimensions and alignment
4. padding increments in 8dp or 4dp
5. > keylines are an alignment tool that enables consistent placement of elements outside of the layout grid
6. container is an enclosed area that holds ui elements; it can be rigid or flexible
7. use the consistent aspect ratios(width/height): 16:9; 3:2; 4:3; 1:1; 3:4; 2:3
8. when flexible ratio is required, fix width to total width of column(s) and let content determine height
9. responsive cropping of images:
    + maintain ratio
    + switch ratios at breakpoints
    + fixed height, fluid width
10. touch targets should be at least 48dp * 48dp, with 8dp of spacing in between
