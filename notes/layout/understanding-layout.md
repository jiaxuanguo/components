# [Understanding layout](https://material.io/design/layout/understanding-layout.html)
1. principles:
   + predictable
   + consistent
   + responsive
2. three main regions for a large screen layout:
   + app bar
   + navigation - 256dp expanded / 72dp collapsed; modal if screen width is below 600dp
   + body - scales responsively to fill screen
3. group elements with similar content or functionality together
4. implicit containment with variation in spacing; explicit containment with borders
5. lines of text shouldn't be too long
6. anchor internal elements when scaling layout containers
7. increment measurements in 8dp or 4dp(for smaller elements)
