# [Pixel Density](https://material.io/design/layout/pixel-density.html)
1. use a device-independent unit for consistency across platforms, devices and screens
2. material design uses dp(density-independent pixel)
3. sp(scalable pixel) is similar to dp, but for fonts. It preserves user's font settings
